# To Do
# 1. Traci Error.
# 2. Codalab uploading.
# 3. Cut-in scenario does not work.
# 4. Overtake scenario does not have enough diversity.
# 5. Retrain model.
# 6. Different traffic rou.xml file is built each time. For evaluation, fix the built rou.xml files to ensure same score for same models.
# 7. Preferably, redirect participants to get the competition starter code from SMARTS Github repository.
# 8. Use requirements.txt to install dependencies from paticipant submission for evaluation.
# 9. Rank scores in order of priority i.e., completion > time > humanness > rules.
